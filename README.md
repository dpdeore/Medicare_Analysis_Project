# Regression analysis on medicare spend!

## Overview
Medical expenses are one of the major recurring expenses in a human life. Itâ€™s a common 
knowledge that one life style and various physical parameters dictates diseases or ailments one 
can have and these ailments dictates medical expenses.
In U.S. Medicare is a federal government health insurance program that subsidizes healthcare
services.It primarily provides health insurance for Americans aged 65 and older, but also for 
some younger people with disability status as determined by the Social Security Administration 
(SSA).

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to use the trained models to predict Medicare charges,This model 
helps the people to plan their financial investments better way.

## Dataset
We use healthcare dataset of U.S. country.This dataset contains 163065 rows,19 columns.
It includes following key information
. Diagnosis related groups (DRGs) Definition are a patient classification scheme which provides a means of relating the type of     patients a hospital treats to the costs incurred by the hospital
. It contains columns as Insured and Non-insured males and females of age group 18-25.
. Hospital Referral Region Description
. Total discharges 
. Average Medicare Payments
. Average Total Payments
. Provider Zip Code
. State

## Data Visualization
Plot Bar graph and pie chart to find answers of following questions:

TOP 10 MEDICARE PROVIDERS
Top 10 medicare provider and their avg medicare payments
Total number of DRG defination
Statewise number of medicare providers
Pie chart of states wise Avg medicare payments
States wise count of Insured Males and females

## Analytics Technique
The aim of project is to build an analytical model predicting Average medicare payments. We used the different Regressions to build the machine-learning model.

## Jupyter Notebook
Visualization and Analysis notebooks are available in this Github.
